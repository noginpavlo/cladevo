## Overview

Cladevo is an online tool designed for constructing phylogenetic trees using the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) algorithms. It allows users to generate dendrograms quickly based on flexible data input methods, including FASTA files, Excel files, or manual DNA sequence input.

This tool is ideal for researchers, educators, and students who need an accessible solution for phylogenetic analysis. Scientists can use Cladevo for preliminary data exploration before transitioning to more advanced bioinformatics tools like MEGA or DarWin, while students can gain hands-on experience with phylogenetic tree construction.

## Features & Functionality

* Phylogenetic Tree Construction: Supports Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and UPGMA algorithms for genetic relationship analysis.

* Flexible Data Input: Accepts FASTA files, Excel files, or manually entered DNA sequences.

* Automated Processing: Sequence alignment, dissimilarity matrix calculation, and dendrogram construction are fully automated.

* Molecular Marker Analysis: Compatible with SSR genotyping, PCR, and gel electrophoresis data.

* Speed & Accessibility: No installation required; generate trees in seconds.

* Educational Resources: Learn about UPGMA and NJ algorithms in the Theory section.

* Completely Free: No subscription, authentication, or adsâ€”just an open-access tool for all users.

## Installation & Setup
